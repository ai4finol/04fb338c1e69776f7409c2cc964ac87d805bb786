Online portfolio selection (OLPS) is an important issue in operations research community that studies how to dynamically
adjust portfolios according to market changes. In the past, OLPS research relied on a general database called ``OLPS`` 
containing price relatives data of financial assets across different markets. However, with the widespread adoption of 
data-driven technologies like machine learning in finance, ``OLPS`` can no longer meet the needs of OLPS research because 
due to the lack of support for complex data types, high-dimensional feature spaces, and multi-source data fusion. To solve 
this problem, we propose ``FinOL``, an open finance database for advancing research in data-driven OLPS. ``FinOL`` expands 
and enriches the previous ``OLPS`` database, containing 8 benchmark financial datasets from 1962 to present across global 
markets. To promote fair comparisons, we evaluate a large number of past classic OLPS methods on ``FinOL``, providing 
reusable benchmark results for future ``FinOL`` users and effectively supporting OLPS research. Importantly, we are 
committed to regularly updating ``FinOL`` with new data and benchmark results reflecting the latest developments and 
trends in the field. This ensures ``FinOL`` remains a valuable resource as data-driven OLPS methods continue evolving.
